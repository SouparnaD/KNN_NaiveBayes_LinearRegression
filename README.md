"# KNN_NaiveBayes_LinearRegression" 


1. We will be working on two datasets as part of this question.
	1. Robot1 & Robot2 The robot problem is from arti?cial robot domain in which robots are described by 6 di?erent attributes. The learning task is a binary classi?cation task. Perform modelling on both the datasets. Data is available at http://preon.iiit.ac.in/~sanjoy_chowdhury/RobotDataset.zip

	2. Iris.csv The data set consists of samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Data and it’s description is available at http://preon.iiit.ac.in/~sanjoy_chowdhury/ Iris.zip
Use the above datasets to answer following questions



	1. Implement a KNN classi?er for each of the datasets. Report precision, recall, f1 score and accuracy. Compare your result with in-built(scikit-learn) KNN function to check correctness of your algorithm.
	2. Use di?erent distance measures as applicable. Plot graph to report accuracy with change in value of K. Also suggest possible reason for better performance.


2. A bank is implementing a system to identify potential customers who have higher probablity of availing loans to increase its pro?t. Implement Naive Bayes classi?er on this dataset to help bank achieve its goal. Report your observations and accuracy of the model. Data is available at http://preon.iiit.ac.in/~sanjoy_chowdhury/ LoanDataset.zip
3. We are given a dataset containing various criteria important to get admissions into Master’s program and probablity of getting an admit. Dataset is available at http://preon.iiit.ac.in/~sanjoy_chowdhury/AdmissionDataset.zip
1. Implement a model using linear regression to predict the probablity of getting the admit.
2. Compare the performance of Mean square error loss function vs Mean Absolute error function vs Mean absolute percentage error function and explain the reasons for the observed behaviour.
3. Analyse and report the behaviour of the coe?cients(for example: sign of coe?cients, value of coe?cients etc.) and support it with appropriate plots as necessary.
